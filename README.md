# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect melanoma skin cancer from dermoscopic images. Using a dataset of 10,000 skin lesion images, we apply various ML techniques including reinforcement learning concepts to build an intelligent diagnostic system.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Source**: [Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10000 Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images)

- **Total Images**: 10,000 dermoscopic images
- **Classes**: Benign and Malignant skin lesions
- **Format**: High-resolution medical images
- **Application**: Early detection and diagnosis of melanoma

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning principles to medical image classification, treating the diagnostic process as an intelligent agent learning to make optimal decisions.

### Key Concepts Applied:

- **Observation**: Image features and characteristics extracted from dermoscopic images
- **Action**: Classification decisions (benign vs malignant)
- **Reward**: Accuracy of diagnostic predictions
- **Episode**: Complete diagnostic workflow from image input to final classification

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Environment Setup
- Initialize the medical diagnostic environment
- Collect training data through random sampling
- Store observations, actions, and rewards in structured format

### Phase 2: Model Training
- Apply reinforcement learning principles to medical diagnosis
- Train ensemble models on collected diagnostic data
- Implement reward-based learning system

### Phase 3: Intelligent Agent Deployment
- Deploy trained model for real-time diagnosis
- Achieve significant performance improvement over random classification
- Target: >50% accuracy improvement over baseline

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

### Expected Results:
- **Baseline (Random)**: ~1-2% accuracy
- **Trained Model**: 15-50% improvement
- **Target Performance**: >90% diagnostic accuracy

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Classification Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Approach**: Novel application of RL concepts to medical diagnosis
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple model comparison and selection
- **Reward Engineering**: Sophisticated reward system for optimal learning
- **Scalable Architecture**: Extensible to other medical imaging tasks
